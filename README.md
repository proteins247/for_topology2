# Data on /E. coli/ cotranslational folding

Data generated in Jacobs and Shakhnovich 2017 and data for Zhao et al. 2020 are put in `data.csv`.

The protein structures used in Zhao et al. 2020 are in `structures`. `get_structures.py` is a reference file for how `data.csv` was built, but the script cannot be run by itself.

`find_cotranslational_folders.py` identifies proteins likely to cotranslationally fold based on analysis and data from Jacobs and Shakhnovich 2017.
